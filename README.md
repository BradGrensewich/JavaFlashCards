-save a log of current session to a file

# At launch
You can also import a deck from a file at program launch using cmd arguments formatted as: 

-import "FILENAME"

where "FILENAME" is the name of file to be used.


Likewise, you can use cmd arguments at program launch to have a file set to export the used deck of cards at prgram close. cmd argument formatted as:

-export "FILENAME"

same as above.


You can import and export 1 files each simultaneously, will need to import additional decks through the UI if you want to use multiple decks of cards in one session
